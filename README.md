# Music_classifier
Play a song and find out what genre it is. I've converted audio samples to a trainable form, using signal processing techniques. 
I then used CNN's to develop the model for training and testing. Test accuracy close to 80%
The Data folder contains the GTZAN music dataset, used for this project. 

The Code folder contains two files, music_classifier_processing notebook that shows you how to extract information from an audio file and the music_classifier_model notebook that develops a CNN, and compares other networks as alternatives after extracting necessary information into a json file.
